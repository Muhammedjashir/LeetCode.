// Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".

// You are given a positive integer k.

// Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:

//     Generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.

// For example, performing the operation on "c" generates "cd" and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".

// Return the value of the kth character in word, after enough operations have been done for word to have at least k characters.

// Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the operation.

// Example 1:

// Input: k = 5

// Output: "b"

// Explanation:

// Initially, word = "a". We need to do the operation three times:

//     Generated string is "b", word becomes "ab".
//     Generated string is "bc", word becomes "abbc".
//     Generated string is "bccd", word becomes "abbcbccd".

// Example 2:

// Input: k = 10

// Output: "c"


/**
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {character}
 */
 var kthCharacter = function(k) {
   const j= String.fromCharCode((k-1).toString(2).split('1').length+96)
    return j
};
